					<p>
						You can get a copy of the software from <a href="https://github.com/nodebeats/nodebeats">github.com</a>. You can either clone it or directly download it from github. Below is the link to the application code:
						<br>
						<a class="focus_main btn btn-primary" href ="https://github.com/nodebeats/nodebeats">Download Nodebeats
						</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						After you have a copy of this software on your local disk, As always, the first step is to install all the dependencies that this application requires.
					</p>
					<p>
						From the root of your project directory, run the command:
						<br>

						<b class="focus_main command_npm">npm install</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						This will install all the dependencies that are required by the project. Before running it, you have to create database for the application and some users for database authentication purpose.
					</p>

				</div>
				<div class="docpanel doc_start_database">
					<p>
						You have two choices in terms of MongoDB database. Either, You can use local instance of MongoDB database  or choose one of the  Database-as-a-Service providers for MongoDB. <b><a href="https://mlab.com/" target="_blank">mlab</a></b> is one of the most popular Database-as-a-Service provider for MongoDB.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, let's get started with MongoDB database for the application.
					</p>


					<div class="doc_start_mongodb_local">
						<h2>Local Instance of MongoDB</h2>
						<p>
							Obviously,the first thing you might want to do is create and configure the MongoDB database on your local machine. That is exactly what you are going to do now.
						</p>
						<div>
							<p>
								Follow the following step-by-step guidelines to create and configure MongoDB in local machine.
							</p>


							<ol type="1">
								<li>
									<p>
										The first thing, you would want to do is enable access control in MongoDB database because of security risks. Before enabling role based access control, you should first consider the users of the system. So, create a  user with userAdminAnyDatabase role access in admin database, which you will use later to login and create users for any database and then enable authentication.
									</p>
									<p>
										To create a user for admin database, open the terminal and run <b>mongo</b> command.
										<br>
										<b class="focus_main command_mongo"> mongo</b>
									</p>
									<p>
										Run the following command to create user administrator for your mongodb database instance with userAdminAnyDatabase role access with your own unique and strong password:
										<br>
										<b class="focus_main command_mongo">use admin</b>
										<br>

										<pre>
											<code class="hljs bash">
		db.createUser({
			"user":"superadmin",
			"pwd":"superadmin#123",
			"roles":[{
				"role":"userAdminAnyDatabase",
				"db":"admin"
			}]
		})
									</code>
								</pre>

									</p>
									<p>
										This will successfully create user administrator for the mongodb database instance.
									</p>

								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										After creating user administrator, enable the access control feature in mongodb database server.  To enable it, run the following command with sudo access in ubuntu.
									</p>
									<br>

										<p><b class="focus_main command_terminal">
											sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf</b>

										</p>


									<br>
									<p>
										You will be prompted for administrative password. Enter your password and press enter. Navigate to security section and uncomment both lines.
									</p>
									<br>
							<pre>
								<code class="hljs bash">
			security:
			authorization: enabled
								</code>
							</pre>
									<p>And finally save it before you exit the terminal.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Restart the mongodb server instance
									</p>
									<br>

										<p>
											<b class="focus_main command_mongo">
											sudo service mongod restart</b>
										</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Now run the mongodb instance with newly created user
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>

										<b class="focus_main command_mongo">
											mongo --host localhost --port 27017 -u "superadmin" -p "superadmin#123" --authenticationDatabase "admin"
										</b>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>Now create a database. To create database, enter following command</p>
									<br>
									<p>

										<b class="focus_main command_mongo"> use dbName</b>
									</p>
									<br>
									<p>
										This will create database with specified name. Now it's time to add users to it.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Create two users for the database. One will be database admin user and other will be user with readWrite access only.
									</p>
									<p>
										You will use this  user for accessing the database from terminal. So, Create user with dbAdmin role:
										<br>

								<pre>
									<code class="hljs bash">
			use dbName


			db.createUser({
					"user":"nodebeatssuperadmin",
					"pwd":"nodebeatssuperadmin#123",
					"roles":[{
					"role":"dbAdmin",
					"db":"prj_nodebeats"
				},{
					"role":"userAdmin",
					"db":"prj_nodebeats"
				},{
					"role":"dbOwner",
					"db":"prj_nodebeats"
				}]
			})
					</code>
				</pre>
									</p>
									<p>
										Following is the user which you will use to connect to the database from web application.

				<pre>
					<code class="hljs bash">
				use dbName


				db.createUser({
					"user":"nodebeatsadmin",
					"pwd":"nodebeatsadmin#123",
					"roles":[{
						"role":"readWrite",
						"db":"prj_nodebeats"
					}]
				})
			</code>
		</pre>
									</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</div>
						<p>
							So, You now have a database with some users on it. Copy the username, password and database name. you will need that later when running the application.

						<h2>Database-as-a-service for MongoDB - mlab </h2>
						<p>
							You can also use <b><a href="https://mlab.com/">mlab</a></b> to host the database in the cloud. Create an account on mlab.  Click on the verification email sent to your email and then after account is verified successfully, create a new database in <b>mlab</b> with some users on it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Here is format of the mlab mongodb connection url:
							<br>
							<b class="focus_secondary url_mongo"> mongodb://dbuser:dbpassword@ds031845.mlab.com:31845/prj_nodebeats</b>
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							You can find detailed instructions <a href="https://docs.mlab.com/">here</a>  to get started with mlab.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="docpanel doc_start_configure_db">
					<p>
						So, you now have database with users on it. It's time to edit the database configuration file before running the application. To edit the database configuration file, follow the following steps:
					</p>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>
							<p>
								Go to the <b>root</b> of your project directory and then navigate to <b>lib</b> folder from there. 	There, you will find <b>configs</b> directory where configuration file for mongodb database 	connection resides. The file name is <b> database.config.js</b></p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Open the file in any editor and change the connection url properties with previously created 	user credentials. You need <b>username of the user</b> , <b>password</b>, <b>database name</b>, <b>host name</b> and then <b>port number</b> of the host server.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						After you have changed the connection url properties of the database config file, Now, it's time to run your web application.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="docpanel doc_start_run_application">
					<p>To run your node.js application, navigate to the project root directory from the terminal and then run the following command:
						<br>
						<b class="focus_main command_node"> node server.js</b>
						<br>
						or
						<br>
						<b class="focus_main command_node"> gulp </b>
					</p>
					<p>
						The first run will take some time as it creates a default application user with username  = <b>superadmin</b> and password = <b>superadmin@123</b>  and also creates EmailTemplate collection. The collections created are <b>User</b>, <b>DefaultUserStatus </b> and <b>EmailTemplate</b>  collections.
					</p>
					<p>
						During this process, it will change the <b>mongo.restore.config.json</b>  file which you can locate in <b> mongodump folder</b> inside of <b>lib directory </b> and modify the value of <b>restored to true</b>. If you want <b>to  run the web application from scratch again </b> due to some reason, you need to <b>modify the value of restored to false</b>. This way, it will run the web application from scratch and restores the database.
					</p>

					<div>
						<p>Now that you have your server up and running, open the browser and browse <b> http://localhost:3000</b>. If everything is ok, then you will see the homepage.</p>


						<br>
						<img src="{{protocol}}://res.cloudinary.com/{{cloudinaryname}}/image/upload/v1471427680/homepage_m0guov.png">
						<p>
							So, the first step is complete. Now to make the website fully functional, you still need to configure various setttings of  application. For that, you need to login to the application and enter data for various settings configurations from the dashboard menu.
						</p>
						<br>


					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="docpanel doc_start_login_application">
					<p>
						To login, navigate to
						<br>
						<b>http://localhost:3000/login</b>
					</p>
					<img src="{{protocol}}://res.cloudinary.com/{{cloudinaryname}}/image/upload/v1470738860/login_fjtj61.png">
					<div>
						<p>When you first run the application, it will restore the database backup archive file having Users collection  with a default user with username = superadmin and password  = superadmin@123.</p>


						<br>
						<p>
							username : <b>superadmin</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							password :  <b>superadmin@123 </b>
						</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						Use above credentials to login to the application and we highly recommend you to change the default password as soon as you login to your application successfully as it will create security mishaps if you keep as it is, since everyone will know the default password.
					</p>
					<p>
						If login is successfull, you will be redirected to the dashboard page.
					</p>
					<br>
					<img src="{{protocol}}://res.cloudinary.com/{{cloudinaryname}}/image/upload/v1470738860/dashboard_shg3tz.png">

				</div>
				<div class="docpanel doc_start_user_mgmt">
					<p>
						As part of the user management, you can do various things like registering new users, changing user password, enabling two factor authentication and changing security answers.
					</p>
					<p class="critical_warning">
						If you are running the application for the first time, We strongly recommend you to change the default password immediately the first time you login.
					</p>
					<p>
						To change the password, click on the dropdown menu from the <b>Welcome superadmin</b>  section <b>at the top</b>  and then click on <b>Profile navigation menu</b>. Or, you can also click on the User Navigation menu from the left side bar.
						<br>
						<img src="{{protocol}}://res.cloudinary.com/{{cloudinaryname}}/image/upload/v1470738860/user-profile_tbh4on.png">
					</p>
					<p>
						Click on password tab.
						<br>
						You must enter very <b>strong password with the combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols</b> . We recommend you to enter <b>password of length greater than 8 characters</b>.
						<br>
						<img src="{{protocol}}://res.cloudinary.com/{{cloudinaryname}}/image/upload/v1470738860/password-change_q1c2cr.png">
					</p>
					<p>
						After you have changed password successfully, we also recommend you to <b>enable two-factor authentication</b>  as it will give you extra layer of security. To enable two factor authentication or multi-factor authentication, click on the Settings tab from the user profile page.
						<br>
						<img src="{{protocol}}://res.cloudinary.com/{{cloudinaryname}}/image/upload/v1470738860/multi-factor-authentication-setting_ceu5hh.png">
					</p>
					<p>
						<b> Slide the toggle button</b> to enable two-factor authentication. This will take you to two-factor authentication setup section. When two-factor authentication is enabled, then you must initially provide username and password and on  successfully authenticating the user with those credentials will take you to the <b>time based one time password verification</b>  page. Only if you provide the correct token, you will be redirected to the dashboard page.

						<br>
						So, slide the toggle button .
						<br>
						<img src="{{protocol}}://res.cloudinary.com/{{cloudinaryname}}/image/upload/v1470738860/two-factor-auth-set-up_ko9jcr.png">
					</p>
					<p>
						To enable two-factor authentication for your web application, you need to scan the QR code section which will respond back with Time based one time password i.e. TOTP token
					</p>
					<p>
						To get that TOTP token, you need app that can verify 2-step verification codes.  Next, you are going to set-up two-factor authentication and install required app.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="docpanel doc_start_2fa_setup">
					<p>
						We need some kind of applications that can scan QR code, generate TOTP token and verify it at the same time. There are many alternatives but the most popular one is <b>Google Authenticator</b>  and there is another one which is also popular <b>Authy</b>. So, go to the <b>Google play store </b> if you are in android and download    either one of those app and install in your phone.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you choose to  use Google authenticator, then you can follow below link for detailed guidance.
						<br>
						<a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en">https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en</a>
						<br>
						Go through the set-up process. Here are the some of the snapshots of the application.
						<br>
						<img class="width_half_img" src="{{protocol}}://res.cloudinary.com/{{cloudinaryname}}/image/upload/v1470738860/google-authenticator-app-set-up_c8ismf.png">

					<p>
						If you choose to use <b>Authy</b> application, then you can follow below links for the guidance
						<br>
						<a href="https://www.authy.com/tutorials/">https://www.authy.com/tutorials/</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, you have authenticator app installed in your mobile device, scan the QR code with your authenticator app and then enter the TOTP token into the textbox and click on verify button. If everything works fine, then two-factor authentication is successfully enabled for your user account.
					</p>
					<div>
						<b>Note:</b>
						<br>
						<p>
							If, somehow token is not verified, this may be due to the reason that the time on your Google authenticator app is not synced correctly with the server.</p>
						<br>
						To fix this:
						<ol type="1">
							<li><p>Go to the main menu on the Google Authenticator app</p> </li>
							<li><p>Click Settings </p></li>
							<li><p>Click Time correction for codes</p></li>
							<li><p>Click Sync now</p></li>
						</ol>
						<br>

						<h2>Google's SMTP Server Email Service Provider:</h2>
						<p>
							As we all know that Google provides a widely popular webmail, Gmail, but it also provides us with a smtp server which can be used to deliver emails.
							<br>
							Google's SMTP server requires authentication, so here's how to set it up:
						</p>
						<ol type="1">
							<li>
								<p>
									SMTP server (i.e., outgoing mail): smtp.gmail.com
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									SMTP username: Your full Gmail or Google Apps email address (e.g. example@gmail.com or example@yourdomain.com)
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									SMTP password: Your Gmail or Google Apps email password
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									SMTP port: 465
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									SMTP TLS/SSL required: yes
								</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							If you want to store a copy of outgoing emails in your sent folder of  gmail account:
						</p>
						<ol type="1">
							<li>
								<p>
									Login to your gmail account with valid credentials
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Click on the Settings icon and from dropdown, click on Settings menu
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Then Click on Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab  and scroll down to the IMAP Access section.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Check the Enable IMAP radio button.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<br>
						<img src="{{protocol}}://res.cloudinary.com/{{cloudinaryname}}/image/upload/v1470738860/gmail-imap-setting_juiimx.png">
						<br>
						<p>
							Google will block sign in attempts at the domain or Organizational Unit level from some apps or devices that do not use modern security standards. So, <b>to be able to send emails using Gmail as email service provider</b>, you must <b>turn on Access for less secure apps feature</b>. Only after turning that   feature, you will be able to send emails using Google Smtp server.
						</p>
						<p>
							This will make your account more vulnerable. So, we recommend you to use either of the above transactional email service providers rather than google smtp server for sending emails.
						</p>
						<p>
							To turn on Allow less secure apps feature:
							<br>
							<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps">https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps</a>

						</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<p>
						<b>Note:</b>
						<br>
						For all transactional email service providers, it would be best to supply domain verified email address in the sender field of all the email template data. So you must update the email templates records so that all of the records will have domain verified email address in their sender or from text  field.

					<h2>Deploying to the cloud:</h2>
					<p>
						Before, deploying project to the cloud, you have to do certain things like creating backup of the database so that you can restore the database archive file directly to the prouction MongoDB server. Likewise, it's good idea to generate shrinkwrap.json file before deploying.
					</p>
					<br>
					<div class="db_backup_generate">
						<p>
							<b>Creating a backup archive file of MongoDB database:</b>
							<br>
							Before  deploying the project to the cloud, create a backup of your mongodb database in archive extension format. This backup file in archive format will restore only on MongoBD version greater than v3.2
						</p>
						<ol type="1">
							<li>
								<p>
									To create backup of MongoDB database in archive extension format, run the following command:
									<br>
								<pre>
									<code class="hljs bash">
	mongodump --host hostname --port porttNumber --username userName --password 	passwordEntry --db dbName --gzip –archive=filePath
									</code>
								</pre>
								<p>

									Give the appropriate file path.
									<br>
									ex:
									<br>
								</p>
								<pre>
									<code class="hljs bash">
	mongodump --host localhost --port 27017 --username nodebitsadmin --password 	nodebitsadmin#123 --db prj_nodebeats --gzip --archive="/home/lakhe/Music/production test 	files/prj_nodebeats.archive"
									</code>
								</pre>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Now you have archive file, Open the another terminal and run the following command to restore the database file in the production MongoDB server.
								</p>
								<pre>
									<code class="hljs bash">
	mongorestore --host hostname --port portNumber --username userName --password passwordEntry  --gzip --archive=filePath --db dbName
									</code>
								</pre>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							<b>Note:</b>
							<br>
							That's it, Now when you are ready to  deploy the project in the cloud you can restore the database directly in the production server.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="npm_shrinkwrap">
						<p>
							<b>Creating npm-shrinkwrap.json file:</b>
							<br>
							Next, if you have changed or updated the npm packages, you need to recreate the npm-shrinkwrap.json file. The <b>npm shrinkwrap</b> command lets you lock down the versions of a package's dependencies so that you can control exactly which versions of each dependency will be used when your package is installed. This is important because when installing the packages using <b>npm install</b> command, there is no guarantee that same exact package version will be installed and this may bring bugs to the application. In production environment, It may create unwanted problems and risks.
						</p>
						<p>
							So, recreate the npm-shrinkwrap.json file if you have updated or installed the new packages.

										Type yes to generate token so that we do not have to provide username and password every-time we try to access openshift server via terminal.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										You will be prompted to upload SSH key to the Openshift server. Type yes and press enter. This must be done so that we can access code from git. So, if everything is fine, it’s time to create our application in openshift.

								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Create the application in Openshift server by running the following command:
										<br>
									<pre>
										<code class="hljs bash">
rhc create-app --app appName  nodejs-0.10 mongodb-2.4 "http://cartreflect-claytondev.rhcloud.com/reflect?github=smarterclayton/openshift-redis-cart"
										</code>
									</pre>
									<br>
									Or
									<br>
									<pre>
										<code class="hljs bash">
rhc app  create -a appName -t nodejs-0.10 --env NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=”true”
										</code>
									</pre>
									<br>
									<p>Either one of them will create application in Openshift</p>
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>
												What this will do is that it creates the application named appName and add cartridges Node.js, MongoDB and redis to it.
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												Replace appName with your custom application name.
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												During the application creation process, you may be prompted to verify the authenticity of the host. If so, then just type yes and enter.
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												Your application will also be cloned to your machine. If somehow, application cloning is failed on your machine, then what we can do is copy the value of Git remote value and then run the following command:
												<br>
												<b class="command_git">git clone clone_url</b>
												<br>
												ex:
												<br>
											<pre>
												<code class="hljs bash">
git clone ssh://57a1a4bd89f5cf56530000d8@nodebeats-nodebeats.rhcloud.com/~/git/nodebeats.git/

									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										If you want to add Web-based MongoDB administration tool, there is RockMongo cartridge. For this to be installed in our server, it requires MongoDB cartridge to be installed already. To install rockmongo cartridge,
										<br>
										<b class="command_terminal">rhc cartridge add rockmongo-1.1 -a appName</b>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Openshift allows you to remotely access your's application's gears in order to perform various tasks such as troubleshooting working with log files and managing environment variables. If you want to access your remote server, then run the following command:
										<br>
										<b class="command_terminal">rhc ssh appName</b>
									</p>
									<p>
										Be extremely careful while using shell access. Shell access is quite powerful and it is 	possible for you to accidentally damage your application.
									</p>
									<br>
									<img src="{{protocol}}://res.cloudinary.com/{{cloudinaryname}}/image/upload/v1470738860/rhc-ssh-access_fyndw4.png">
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Next thing, that you may want in your application is continuous integration. Openshift provides Continuous integration with Jenkins. Jenkins is a full featured continuous integration (CI) server that can run builds, tests, and other scheduled tasks and integrate with your  Openshift applications. So, before enabling continuous integration with jenkins, you have to setup Jenkins server.

										<br>
										For detailed guidelines:
										<br>
										<a href="https://developers.openshift.com/managing-your-applications/continuous-integration.html">https://developers.openshift.com/managing-your-applications/continuous-integration.html</a>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										To enable Jenkins server
										<br>
										<b class="teminal_command">
											rhc app create jenkins jenkins-1
										</b>
										<br>
										where <b>jenkins</b>  is the  name of the jenkins server and <b>jenkins-1</b> is the cartridge.
									</p>
									<img src="{{protocol}}://res.cloudinary.com/{{cloudinaryname}}/image/upload/v1470738860/rhc-jenkins_urudaf.png">
									<p>
										<b>Note:</b>
										<br>
										While setting up Jenkins server, if warning shows, just ignore it. But note the administrator username and password that is created and returned from rhc. This will be needed to administer jenkins.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Since, we have our application already created, we have to enable continuous integration with jenkins. For that add jenkins cartridge to our application by running the following command:
										<br>
										<b class="termial_command">
											rhc cartridge add jenkins-client-1 -a appName
										</b>
										<br>
										<img src="{{protocol}}://res.cloudinary.com/{{cloudinaryname}}/image/upload/v1470738860/rhc-jenkins-enable-ci_tdwe0s.png">
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Now, that we have enabled continuous integration with jenkins, now  Go to the directory where you have clone the openshift application and delete existing files and place your project files in the project root directory.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Before committing files to the git repository, we have to change some of the code to make application work in openshift.
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>
												Now, we have our server ready, still we  have to change the <b>database config     (database.config.js)</b> to make our application run. So, in the <b>database.config.js</b> file <b>located at /lib/configs path</b> from the root of the application, change the following in the production section.
											</p>
										<pre>
											<code>
production : {
    username: 'username',
	password: 'password',
	host: $OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_HOST,
	port: $OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_PORT,
	dbName: 'dbname'
},
											</code>
										</pre>
											<br>
											<p>Open the ssh terminal access to your Openshift application and then run the following environment variables to get the MongoDB credentials and replace the ouput value in the production section of database config file.

											</p><pre>
											<code>
echo $OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_HOST
echo $OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_PORT
echo $OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_USERNAME
echo $OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_PASSWORD
echo $OPENSHIFT_MONGODB_DB_URL
											</code>
										</pre>
											<br>

											Or,
											<br>
											<p>
												Run <br>
												<b class="command_terminal">rhc show-app appName</b>
												<br>
												to get the detailed information about application where you can find username, password and database name for mongodb configuration. Replace the username, password and dbName with those values.
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												Last, we also need to change the configuration file for <b>redis.config.js</b> located at <b>/lib/configs</b> from the root of the application.
											</p>
										<pre>
											<code>
production : {
	host: '$OPENSHIFT_REDIS_HOST',
	port: '$OPENSHIFT_REDIS_PORT',
	pass: '$REDIS_PASSWORD'
}
											</code>
										</pre>
											<br>
											<p>
												Similarly, Run the following commands in the ssh terminal and replace the output in the redis config file
											</p>
											</p><pre>
											<code>
echo $OPENSHIFT_REDIS_HOST
echo $OPENSHIFT_REDIS_PORT
echo $REDIS_PASSWORD
echo $REDIS_CLI
											</code>
										</pre>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												To see redis deployed in openshift, login to the openshift server using shell command.
												<br>
												<b class="command_terminal">rhc ssh appName</b>
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												After you have shell access, run the following command to get the information about Redis instance.
												<br>
												<b class="command_terminal">env | grep REDIS</b>
												<br>
											<p>
												After you have run this command, you will see all the needed the information about 	the redis instance. <b>Copy the host, port and   password in the redis.config.js file </b>
											</p>
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												If you want to connect to the redis, run the following command:
												<br>
												<b class="command_terminal">
													redis-cli $REDIS_CLI
												</b>
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>

										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										So, all the configurations of your application are set. Please do not place the node_modules directory in the git cloned directory. If, exists, delete the node_modules directory. While deployment, it will be automatically downloaded and built.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Now, Add all the files to the repository except node_modules folder if exists. They will be automatically downloaded once we push our files to the repository.
										<br>
										<b class="command_git">git add --all</b>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Commit the files to the git repository.
										<br>
										<b class="command_git">git commit -m "entire application files committed for the first time"</b>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Push the files to the git repository
										<br>
										<b class="command_git">
											git push origin master
										</b>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										It will start building the application and at the same time, download all the required packages.

						<p>If you are using  free account provided by Openshift, then I would like to warn you that deployment may not be smooth. It may result in failure.  Openshift provides 1GB of storage space which sounds like a lot before deployment but it’s actually not. </p>
						<p>
							After deploying application to the Openshift cloud, login to the Openshift terminal using following ssh command:
							<br>
							<b class="command_node">rhc ssh -a appName</b>
							<br>
							After login to the openshift server, <b> first thing you should do is delete everything from /tmp folder. Files in the temp folder are cleared automatically on next server restart. So, if server space is not full, then you can skip this step.</b>

					<h2><b>Nginx setup in Openshift</b></h2>

					<div class="setup">
						<p>
							Now that you have created and deployed your web application successfully, it's time to set-up Nginx as our proxy server that will serve all the static contents.
						</p>
						<p>

							You have to know that we cannot setup Nginx alongside our Node.js web application because Openshift doesn't allow it.
							So, we have to create seperate application and then proxy the client request back to our Node.js application.
							Nginx allows us to create upto three small basic gears with the free account. So, let's get started:
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Note:</b>
							<br>
							Application name must contain only alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, or 0-9).
						</p>
						<p>
							We will be using Openshift Open-Source Nginx cartridge which you can find using following link:
							<br>
							<a href="https://github.com/gsterjov/openshift-nginx-cartridge">https://github.com/gsterjov/openshift-nginx-cartridge</a>
						</p>
						<p>
							This Nginx cartridge installs Nginx v1.4.4 which is ofcourse outdated but that's not a problem because once this cartridge is installed and we have our Nginx on Openshift up and running, we can update the Nginx using our own custom configurations by compiling Nginx from source and then installing it.
							So, Go to the github repository page and read the instructions there.
						</p>
						<p>
							So, Follow the following guidelines to create Nginx application on Openshift:
						</p>
						<div>
							<ul type="1">
								<li>
									<p>
										To create application, run the following command:
										<br>
										<b>
											rhc create-app myapp http://cartreflect-claytondev.rhcloud.com/reflect?github=gsterjov/openshift-nginx-cartridge
										</b>
										<br>
										This will create Nginx web server application on Openshift. Here <b>myapp is your custom application name</b>.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Now that your Nginx web server is up and running, it's time to update it.
										<br>
										SSH into your application server and Navigate to data directory of app-root folder.
										<br>
										<b>cd app-root/data</b>
									</p>
									<p>
										We will compile and build our Nginx server application in this directory. <b>In Openshift server, Only data directory is the persistent one.</b> So, If you need some data to be persistent across deployments, then, use this directory.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										So, Follow the following guidelines to <b>upgrade Nginx versions</b>:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>
												Create a shell script. Name it anything you want. I will name it as <b> compile_nginx.sh</b>
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												Go to <a href="https://gist.github.com/ShrawanLakhe/77c8d125dc4f18dbff54f72cfeb71e21"><b>https://gist.github.com/ShrawanLakhe/77c8d125dc4f18dbff54f72cfeb71e21</b></a> and copy the contents of the gist.
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												Clone your Nginx web application repository somewhere in the disk and place the shell script and commit the file to the repository. Push the changes to the git.
											</p>
											<p>
												<b>git add compile_nginx.sh</b>
												<br>
												<b>git commit -am "shell script committed"</b>
												<br>

												<b>git push origin master</b>
												<br>
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												SSH into your application, and move the shell script from repo directory to the data directory of app-root folder.
												<br>
												<b>
													cd app-root
												</b>
												<br>
												<b>
													mv repo/compile_nginx.sh data/
												</b>
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												Now check your data directory, you will find the shell script. Now run the shell script
												<br>
												<b>
													cd data
												</b>
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												Make the shell script executable by running the following command:
												<br>
												<b>
													chmod 755 compile_nginx.sh
												</b>
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												To compile and install latest Nginx, run the following command
												<br>
												<b>
													./compile_nginx.sh
												</b>
											</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										The compilation process will take some time. Once done, check the nginx version
										<br>
										<b>
											cd nginx/usr/versions/1.11.3/bin/
										</b>
										<br/>
										<b>
											./nginx -v
										</b>

									</p>
									<p>
										You will see the output with latest Nginx version.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Now stop and then again start the nginx server
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>
											./nginx -s stop
										</b>
										<br />
										<b>
											./nginx
										</b>
									</p>
								</li>

									<p>
										To reload nginx configurations:
										<br />
										<b>
											./nginx -s reload

						We will be doing everything using heroku toolbelt. So, you need to first install heroku toolbelt, so that you can use heroku commands from terminal. To install heroku toolbelt, Go to <a href="https://toolbelt.heroku.com/">https://toolbelt.heroku.com/</a> and download the appropriate package for  your machine. Choose Your Operating system and run the specified command.
						<br>
						If you are in Ubuntu, run the following command:

					<h2>Configuring Nginx as proxy server in Heroku</h2>
					<p>
						We are going to setup Nginx as a proxy server which will serve all the static resources and
						then  redirects other requests to Node.js server in Heroku. Setting Nginx with heroku sounds tough,
						but actually it is very easy.
						We just have to understand the concept of multiple buildpacks in Heroku and how that works.
						There may be cases when a single buildpack is not sufficient for our application needs.
						Even in our case, if we want to set nginx as a proxy server, then without multiple buildpacks, we just cannot do it.
						So, if you want to learn more about multiple buildpacks, then follow the following links:
						<br>
						<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-multiple-buildpacks-for-an-app">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-multiple-buildpacks-for-an-app</a>
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						So, let’s get to the main task of setting Nginx as a proxy server.  We will do it from scratch. So, follow the following step-by-step guidelines:
					</p>
					<div>
						<ol type="1">
							<li>
								<p>
									First you need to create application. So create a directory and from inside the folder, run the following command which will create heroku app. Place all of your project files except node_modules folder in the root of this directory.
									<br>
									<strong>heroku create</strong>
									<br>
									If you are not logged in with heroku credentials, then first login with heroku credentials and create the application.
									<br>
									<strong>heroku login</strong>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Initialize the git repository in the directory
									<br>
									<strong>git init</strong>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div>
									<p>Set git remote origin. To see your git remote origin,</p>
									<br>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>Login with correct credentials to access  dashboard section</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>From the dashboard page,  click your app.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Click on Deploy tab and you will find your git remote origin there.</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
									<p>
										ex:<br>
										<strong>heroku git:remote -a young-citadel-30643</strong></p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div>
									<p>
										So, it’s time to work with multiple buildpacks – first one is Node.js buildpack and another one is Nginx buildpack.
										There are two ways in which you can implement multiple buildpacks.
									</p>
									<p>
										One method involves setting buildpacks using terminal command and another one involves creating <b> .buildpacks </b> file inside the project root directory.
									</p>
									<p>
										So, you need two buildpacks. To know more about those buildpacks, Click following git repository link of heroku and search for Node.js and Nginx buildpack repository.
										<br>

											</li>
										</ul>
										<br>
										<p>
											So, let’s look at both.

										</p>
										<br>

										<div class="buildpack_terminal">
											<h3>Setting multiple buildpacks using terminal</h3>
											<br>
											<ul>
												<li>
													<p>
														First method involves setting buildpacks using terminal commands. So, run the following command from the project root directory.
													</p>
													<br>
													<ul>
														<li>
															<p>
																<b>
																	heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs.git
																</b>
															</p>
														</li>
														<li>
															<p>
																<b>
																	heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nginx.git
																</b>
															</p>
														</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
												<li>
													<p>
														That’s it, Now, you need to change some code to make your application run with nginx as proxy server.
													</p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<p>
														If you want to check what buildpacks will be used with your application, then run the following command:
														<br>
														<b>heroku buildpacks</b>
													</p>
												</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
										<div class="buildpack-file">
											<h3>
												Setting multiple buildpacks using .buildpacks file
											</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>
													<p>
														The first step is to set multi-buildpack. So run the following command:
														<br>
														<b>heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-multi.git</b>
													</p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<div>
														<p>This method involves creating a .buildpacks file in the project root directory.
															That file 	should  contain buildpacks in separate lines. That’s all there is to do.</p>
														<br>
														<ul>
															<li>
																<p>
																	<b>touch .buildpacks</b>
																</p>
															</li>
															<li>
																<p>
																	<b>
																		echo 'https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs.git' >> .buildpacks
																	</b>
																</p>
															</li>
															<li>
																<p>
																	<b>
																		echo 'https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nginx.git' >> .buildpacks
																	</b>
																</p>
															</li>
														</ul>
													</div>
												</li>
											</ul>
										</div>

									</div>

								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									If you want to configure Nginx’s worker_processes directive via the NGINX_WORKERS environment variable,
									then run the following command to set your NGINX_WORKERS to 8 on a PX dyno:
									<br>
									<b>
										heroku config:set NGINX_WORKERS=8
									</b>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div>
									<p>
										Now you are going to change some code from project files so that it will  run without errors when deployed.

									</p>
									<br>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>
												If you have file named Procfile in the root directory, then change the content of file to following:
												<br>
												<b>
													web: scripts/build_nginx.sh
												</b>
											</p>
											<p>
												If you haven’t got that file, then create one. It’s a must have file if you want to deploy your application on heroku.
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													<p>
														touch Procfile
													</p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<p>
														echo 'web: scripts/build_nginx.sh' >> Procfile
													</p>
												</li>
											</ul>
											<p class="note">
												Do remember that, the content of Procfile must be changed after the application is deployed 	successfully in order to run the app successfully.
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												Following are the requirements if you want to run your application using nginx as proxy server without any errors:
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													<p>
														Your <b>webserver</b> listens to the socket at <b>/tmp/nginx.socket</b> .
													</p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<p>
														You touch <b>/tmp/app-initialized</b> when you are ready for traffic.
													</p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<p>
														You can start your web server with a shell command.
													</p>
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												So, let’s change our code in server.js file to meet the requirements.
												<br>
												You have to first require fs module.
											</p>
										<pre>
											<code class="hljs bash">
 var fs = require('fs');
											</code>
										</pre>
											<p>
												Replace following piece of code

											</p>

										<pre>
											<code class="hljs bash">
	self.start = function() {
        //  Start the app on the specific interface (and port).
        server.listen(self.port, function() {
            console.log('Node server started on' + self.port + ' at ' + Date(new Date()));
        });
    };
												</code>
											</pre>
											<br>
											<p>with</p>

										<pre>
											<code class="hljs bash">
	self.start = function() {
        //  Start the app on the specific interface (and port).
        server.listen('/tmp/nginx.socket', function() {
        	if (process.env.DYNO) {
			 	console.log('This is on Heroku..!!');
				fs.openSync('/tmp/app-initialized', 'w');
			}
        	console.log('Node server started on' + self.port + ' at ' + Date(new Date()));
        			});
    };
												</code>
											</pre>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												Add files to the git repository
												<br>
												<b>
													git add --all
												</b>
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												Commit the files
												<br>
												<b>
													git commit -am "content committed"
												</b>
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												Push the file to the git
												<br>
												<b>
													git push heroku master
												</b>
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>
												So, if your application is deployed successfully, then again edit the content of Procfile and replace existing content with the following code:
												<br>
												<b>
													web: bin/start-nginx node server.js
												</b>
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<div>
												<p>
													By default, when the app is deployed, it will create <b>config</b> directory and some files inside it.
													Nginx will use those files to server your application. The created files inside of <b>config directory</b> are as follows:
												</p>
												<br>
												<ul>
													<li>
														<p>
															<strong>mime.types</strong>
														</p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<p>
															<strong>nginx.conf.erb</strong>
														</p>
													</li>
												</ul>
												<p>
													Nginx will use this file as it’s configuration file in Heroku.

												</p>
												<div>
													<p>

														If you want your own custom nginx configuration files that will override default 	nginx configurations, then create config directory in your project root directory. So to create 	your own nginx config file, follow the following steps:

													</p>
													<ul>
														<li>
															<p>
																<strong>
																	mkdir config
																</strong>
															</p>
														</li>
														<li>
															<p>
																<strong>
																	cd config
																</strong>
															</p>
														</li>
														<li>
															<p>
																<strong>
																	touch mime.types
																</strong>
																<br>
																mime.types file will be automatically created. So, if you do not want to modify this file, then it’s perfectly ok. If you do change however,  then replace the content of <b> mime.types</b> file with the content content from this
																<a href="https://gist.github.com/ShrawanLakhe/d2f99300748acec87ea861664287cb2d">gist</a>:
															</p>
														</li>
														<li>
															<p>
																<strong>
																	touch nginx.conf.erb
																</strong>
																<br>
																<b>nginx.conf.erb </b>is the file that we need to configure. So, Go to
																<a href="https://gist.github.com/ShrawanLakhe/a00f176496b63c798f6799350e59de89"> this gist </a> and replace the contents of the file with the content of the gist.
																<br>
																You can edit the values of <b>worker_connections</b> and <b> types_hash_max_size</b> according to your needs.
